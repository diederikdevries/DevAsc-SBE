* Task name => GIT
* Task preparation => See ../README.md. 
* Task implementation

  I did create a GIT repository on GitHub, and added a README.md file. Then, I did pull this repo to my local computer.
  To troubleshoot authentication-issues, I changed the README.md, and was a tad surprised that I didn't have to enter credentials. 
* Task troubleshooting => what were the problems encountered?
  No credentials needed?
* Task verification => proof of the quality of the result
  I'll write this file. Push it, make a screenshot of GitHub, and reedit this file. #profit :)
