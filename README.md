# DevAsc-SBE
This is my repository for my skill based exam

# 

Method operandi:

I try most of the time to work from my Mac mini. Not that I hate Linux (Although FreeBSD is better :P), but I like to have my 'own' environment. Of course I will add 'evidence of task done'.

I added 10 directories, for every task 1. At all the directories, I'll add a README.md, with more indepth information on the task.
